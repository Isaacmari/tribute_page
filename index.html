          <h2>Here's the time line of Stephen Curry's Journey to the NBA:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><b>1988</b> - Born in Akron, Ohio at Summa Akron City Hospital.</li>
            <li><b>2004</b> - wanted to play basketball for Virginia Tech but was only offered a walk on spot due to his slender 160-pound frame. He had zero D1 offers until Davidson College took a chance offering him his first D1 scholarship.</li>
            <li><b>2007</b> - with a chip on his shoulder, curry had a lot to prove. He finished his first year in Davidson with 21ppg making him the second highest scorer in the Southern Conference (SoCon) behind Kevin Durant. He was able to take Davidson to the NCAA tournament but fell short to Maryland despite scoring 30 points. Davidson lost 82-70.</li>
            <li><b>2008</b> - He finished the season averaging 25.9 ppg, 2.9 apg, and 2.1 spg. Breaking the record for most three points made in D1 basketball, 159 three pointers, was accompanied with the Most Outstanding Player award. First player from Davidson to accompish that goal.</li>
            <li><b>2009</b> - He passed the 2000-points mark and made a strong push into the NCAA tournament falling short in the final four. He declared for the NBA draft and was selected seventh overall.</li>
            <li><b>2010</b> - He averaged 18.6 ppg, 3.9 apg, and 5.8 rpg while being the first rookie to ever record 166 threes in a single season.</li>
            <li><b>2013</b> - He signed for a four year $44 million contract extension albiet many experts viewed that move risky for the warriors due to his injuries.</li>
            <li><b>2015</b> - wins his frist NBA chambionship.</li>
            <li><b>2016</b> - names the first ever Unanimous MVP, joined the 50-40-90 club and broke the bulls record with 73 wins.</li>
            <li><b>2017</b> - he broke his own three points record for a single season, won back to back MVP and won back to back NBA championships.</li>
            <li><b>2022</b> - He won his first finals MVP and his fourth NBA championship to silence the critics. He graduated from Davidson with a Bachelors of Arts, his jersey was retired with Davidson and was inducted into the Davidson Athletics Hall of Fame.</li>
